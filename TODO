To do:
- union


Done:
- change signature of nextOccurrence to Day -> Maybe (Day, DatePattern)
- implement "count" combinator: count :: Int -> DatePattern -> DatePattern
- use package thyme instead of time
- add week days 
- (take 1 $ skip 5 day) `inEach` april does not work -- it only skips 5 days the first time!
